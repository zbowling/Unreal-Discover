# Discover

Discover is a Mixed Reality (MR) project that demonstrates how to use key MR features and quickly integrate them in your own project.

See the [CONTRIBUTING](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file for how to help out.

This project was built using the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) with [Epic Online Services (EOS)](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-online-services).

You can test out the Unity version of the game on the [Horizon Store - Discover](https://www.meta.com/experiences/7041851792509764/).

## Project Description

In this project you can see how we use Scene API, Interaction SDK, Passthrough, Spatial Anchors and Shared Spatial Anchors.

## How to run the project in Unreal Engine

**NOTE:** This project can only be used with the Meta Quest fork of Unreal Engine. See <a href="#Dependencies">Dependencies</a> for more information.

1. [Configure the project](./Documentation/Configuration.md) with Meta Quest and EOS
2. Make sure you're using  *Unreal Engine 5.5* or newer.
3. Load the MainMenuMap level.
4. To test in Editor you will need to use Quest Link:
    <details>
      <summary><b>Quest Link</b></summary>

    - Enable Quest Link:
        - Put on your headset and navigate to "Quick Settings"; select "Quest Link" (or "Quest Air Link" if using Air Link).
        - Select your desktop from the list and then select, "Launch". This will launch the Quest Link app, allowing you to control your desktop from your headset.
    - With the headset on, select "Desktop" from the control panel in front of you. You should be able to see your desktop in VR!
    - Navigate to Unreal and change the Play Mode to "VR Preview" using the button with 3 stacked dots in UE's main toolbar.
    - The application should launch on your headset automatically
    </details>

## Dependencies

This project requires the Oculus fork of the UE5.5 game engine that you can find [here](https://github.com/Oculus-VR/UnrealEngine/tree/oculus-5.5).<br/>*NOTE:* access to the Oculus fork requires [access to Epic's GitHub](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue-on-github).

The following is required to test this project within Unreal Engine:

- [The Meta Quest Link app](https://www.meta.com/quest/setup/)

### Required minimal version

This version requires the minimum version of the Meta XR Plugin to be 1.109.0 (Version 77.0)

### Oculus Unreal fork

The Oculus Unreal fork will give you the most up to date integration of Oculus features. However, you must build the editor from its source.

1. [Get access to the Unreal source code](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unreal/unreal-building-ue4-from-source/#prerequisites)
2. [Clone the `oculus-5.5` branch of the Oculus fork](https://github.com/Oculus-VR/UnrealEngine/tree/oculus-5.5)
3. [Install Visual Studio](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unreal/unreal-building-ue4-from-source/#to-download-and-build-unreal-engine)
4. Open a command prompt in the root of the Unreal, then run this command:
```sh
.\GenerateProjectFiles.bat -Game UnrealDiscover -Engine <full path to Unreal-Discover directory>\UnrealDiscover.uproject
```
5. Open the `UnrealDiscover.sln` file that has been generated in the `Unreal-Discover` directory.
6. Set `UnrealDiscover` as the start-up project and `Development Editor` as the configuration.
7. Hit `F5` to build and debug the project (and the engine).

## AI coding agents

This repo is wired up for AI coding agents — `AGENTS.md`, `.vscode/extensions.json`, `.mcp.json`, `.cursor/rules/`, and a few client-specific dotfiles surface the **Meta Horizon** VS Code/Cursor extension, the `hzdb` MCP server, and the Meta Quest skill set automatically.

Full toolchain, including Unreal skills and per-client install instructions: [github.com/meta-quest/agentic-tools](https://github.com/meta-quest/agentic-tools).
